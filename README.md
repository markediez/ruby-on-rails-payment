# README

## the fum_website directory stores my working website that only uses HTML, CSS, & Javascript. 
### I get issues with the javascript when trying to use it on rails. 
### I believe the issues resides with one of the following

### * <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

### * <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-easing/1.3/jquery.easing.min.js"></script>
### These two are used in the index.html of the fum_website directory.

* gem 'jquery-rails'
* gem 'jquery-ui-rails'
* gem 'jquery-easing-rails', '~> 0.0.2'
